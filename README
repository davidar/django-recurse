This repository is a packaged version of the recurse Django template tag
written by Lucas Murray.

Usage information according to
<http://www.undefinedfire.com/lab/recursion-django-templates/>
is replicated below:

    Most of the tags are self explanatory, the only one that may cause
    confusion is the main {% recurse %} one. The format for this tag is
    {% recurse [children] with [parent] as [child] %} where "[children]" is the
    property that contains the children of the current element, "[parent]" is
    your starting element and "[child]" is the variable named used in the loop.

    Here is an example of how you can implement a category tree using this
    template tag. As you can see itâ€™s fairly simple and with a couple of
    modifications can be used for just about anything.

        {% load recurse %}
        ... Headers and stuff ...
        {% recurse category.category_set.all with categories as category %}
        <ul>
            {% loop %}
            <li>
                <h{{ level }}>{{ category.title }}</h{{ level }}>
                {% child %}
            </li>
            {% endloop %}
        </ul>
        {% endrecurse %}
        ... The rest of the page ...
